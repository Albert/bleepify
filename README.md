Hosted on [bleepify.albert-hwang.com](bleepify.albert-hwang.com), this project gives your browser the ability to make "music" out of any website.

* Runs on a crazy old version of jQuery
* The [sound came](https://www.freesound.org/people/junggle/sounds/26777/) from [Freesound.org](http://www.freesound.org)
* Built by [Albert Hwang](http://www.albert-hwang.com)
