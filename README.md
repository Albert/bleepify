After installing this bookmarklet, you'll be able to listen to any website you want to!

When turned on, *the bookmarklet will sequentially pass through each element on the page, ringing out a note.  The pitch of the note is determined by how deeply nested the element sits in the page.

Interesting rhythms begin to emerge organically.  Each website has it's own set of musical tropes based on the arrangements modularized code that they use.  <-- thank my artsy-fartsy education for that artsy-fartsy paragraph : )

Anyhow, deets and examples available at:
